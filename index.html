        <p>Hey there! I'm Bella and I'm a Los Angeles based software developer and I find joy in 
          diving into new technologies and building rich interactive web applications. With a unique

          Ruby on Rails, React, Javascript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Node.js, JQuery, D3.js, THREE.js, 
          HTML, CSS & roller skating. So, if your into that kind of thing,
